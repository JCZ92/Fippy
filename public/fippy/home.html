            <p>In 2014, a 57-year-old Japanese man called Yasuo Takamatsu learned how to SCUBA dive specifically so he can look for his wife's remains after she was presumably swept away during the 2011 tsunami. He says her last email to him was "I want to go home", and he is determined to make that happen. As of 2022, he still remains searching and given up hope.  </p>
